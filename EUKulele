## Draft Snakefile Sketch

rule setup_reference:
  ##Builds the reference database if not already built

rule check_if_protein:
    ## uses GeneMark-ES to predict protein coding regions
    ## Or a metaT protein prediction (???)
    ## Also allow users to pass proteins directly.

rule align_reads_against_db:
  ## runs alignment against reference DB and generates .aln files for each contig in each samples

rule estimate_taxonomy_MAG:
  ## based on hits within a MAG file -- estimates the LCA for each MAG based on reference DB
  ## include an additional file that estimates the contamination (?) or shows next higest hits with the MAG
  ## provide basic statistics on the hits

rule estimate_taxonomy_metaT:
  ## for every contig within a metaT -- estimates the LCA for the contig (using hit cutoffs to correspond to species, genus etc.)
  ## groups contig names into various taxonomy units at different levels of interest
